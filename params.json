{"name":"Sfpcbot","tagline":"an irc bot for #sfpc on freenode, http://sfpc.io","body":"This is an irc robot for irc://irc.freenode.net/sfpc and http://sfpc.io\r\n\r\nInstall dependencies with `npm install`\r\n\r\nThen you can mess with bot.coffee (make sure to change the nickname!)\r\n\r\nTo test your bot out, change the nickname and do `npm start`\r\n\r\nThe bot has two functions, `onMessage` and `onPrivateMessage`, which each take a [regular expression][1] to filter on specific messages, and a callback that should return a message to send back. The simplest bot may look like this:\r\n\r\n```coffee\r\n    sfpcbot = require './lib/sfpcbot'\r\n    shibu = new sfpcbot.bot 'simplebot'\r\n\r\n    shibu.onMessage, /*/, (from, message) ->\r\n        \"wow so message so wow\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat shibu bot will send a message, every time it hears any chatter. While the enthusiasm is admirable, lets make something that understands basic American conversational greetings:\r\n\r\n```coffee\r\n    sfpcbot = require './lib/sfpcbot'\r\n    nicebot = new sfpcbot.bot 'nicebot'\r\n\r\n    nicebot.onMessage, /hello/i, (from, message) ->\r\n        \"Hello #{from}\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n If you are new to [regular expressions][1], the `i` after the `/hello/` is not a typo - it says **i**gnore the case of the message. So now our bot only says hello when someone else says \"hello\" or \"Hello\" or \"HeLlO\", and even says your name back!\r\n\r\nOther things to note about the bot, is that everything it hears will be logged to a file `sfpc.log`. If you want to see/edit the magic, check out `lib/sfpcbot.coffee`.\r\n\r\nFeel free to make your own bots, add [issues][2] or submit pull requests to the main sfpcbot!\r\n\r\n[1]: http://codular.com/regex\r\n[2]: http://github.com/jedahan/sfpcbot","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
